## Why are there so many versions / which "Cocos2D-?" should I use?
Cocos2D started out as "Cocos2D-iphone", an Objective-C based engine for developing games for iOS, but years later a new project was created, called "Cocos2D-X", which was basically a complete port of the original engine to C++. Right now, the engine has been re-implemented and ported to many languages and platforms, which one you should use'll probably depend on which language you are most familiar with and which platform you wish to release your game in. The [full list can be found here](https://github.com/cocos2d), the following are the more popular projects:

* [cocos2d-swift](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-swift): the original cocos2d-iphone project, now being reworked for using Apple's new Swift language as well as Objective-C. Only for iOS development.
* [cocos2d-x](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x): C++ port, used for compiling to Windows, Android and iOS platforms, as well as potentially others.
* [cocos2d-html5](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-html5): JavaScript port, used for making canvas and WebGL games for modern Internet Browsers.
* JavaScript Bindings (JSB): binding tools that manage to compile cocos2d-html5's JavaScript code with cocos2d-x's C++, enabling for the development of native applications with JavaScript. Also, in compiled applications interaction between modules developed in JavaScript and C++ is possible.
* [cocos2d-js](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-js): a package containing cocos2d-html5, JSB and a set of command line tools for creating and compiling projects.
* Cocos Code IDE: new Eclipse-based IDE for developing games using cocos2d, integrating proggraming, compiling, running and debugging.
* CocoStudio: a set of graphical tools for developing assets for cocos2d based games, including WYSIWYG GUI editor, data editor (csv/xls/json), animation editor and scene editor.

There also exist ports to Lua, C# (with XNA/MonoGame) and Python.

## Which version should I use?
It's always reccomended that you start with the latest stable version available at the download page for the flavour that you choose. Older versions may still be available for supporting developers in transition, and development/unstable versions are available at each project's GitHub page, but in general the newest stable version is the one you sould be using.
